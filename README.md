## Design

  - Color Scheme

  - Imagery
  - Wireframes
  Wire Frames can be as simple or as complex as you like. It is perfectly acceptable to use a pen and paper to draw out your ideas and then add an image of them into your read.me
  - Site Structure
    ○ Example:
    Love Light Photography consists of 5 page website with 4 pages that the user can navigate between via the navigation bar. The Home page is the default loading page. The Logo is centered and is also linked to the Home Page. On the left hand site of the logo are two navigation links of Home and Packages. And on the right side of the logo are another two navigation links of Gallery and Contact.
  - Imagery used
  - Database structure (PP3, PP4, PP5)
  - Anything else you want to add that relates to UX/UI
